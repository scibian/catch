Description: C++ Automated Test Cases in Headers
 Catch is a multi-paradigm automated test framework for C++
 and Objective-C.
 .
 Its key features are:
  * Distributed as a single header file with no dependencies.
  * Test cases are self-registering.
  * Test cases can be de divided into isolated sections.
  * Behaviour Driven Design style is possible with GIVEN-WHEN-THEN
    in place of test cases and sections.
  * Only one core assertion macro for comparisons; standard language
    operators are used for comparison, yet the expression is decomposed
    and properly logged.
